INTRODUCTION
In today’s competitive environment, performing well in job interviews has become essential for students and professionals. However, many candidates struggle with confidence, communication skills, and understanding how to answer questions effectively. Traditional mock interviews require human interviewers, making the process time-consuming and less accessible.
To solve this challenge, the AI Mock Interview Platform provides an intelligent, accessible, and user-friendly solution that simulates real interview scenarios. Using Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine learning, the system evaluates user responses, provides feedback, and guides candidates toward improvement.

DOMAIN AND RELEVANCE
The project “AI Mock Interview Platform” belongs to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain, using AI and NLP techniques to generate interview questions, understand user responses, and provide intelligent feedback. 
The platform is highly relevant in today’s competitive job market, offering 24/7 interview practice, instant evaluation, and personalized guidance. It helps students and job seekers improve confidence, communication skills, and technical knowledge through an automated, AI-powered interview experience.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
