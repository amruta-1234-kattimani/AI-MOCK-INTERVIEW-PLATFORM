In today’s competitive environment, performing well in job interviews has become essential for students and professionals. However, many candidates struggle with confidence, communication skills, and understanding how to answer questions effectively. Traditional mock interviews require human interviewers, making the process time-consuming and less accessible.
To solve this challenge, the AI Mock Interview Platform provides an intelligent, accessible, and user-friendly solution that simulates real interview scenarios. Using Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine learning, the system evaluates user responses, provides feedback, and guides candidates toward improvement.

OBJECTIVES
1. To design and develop an AI-based platform that simulates real mock interview experiences for students and job seekers.
2. To implement intelligent interview question generation using AI/NLP for HR, technical, and domain-specific interviews.
3. To analyze user responses in real time using Natural Language Processing to evaluate clarity, confidence, fluency, and correctness.
4. To provide instant, personalized feedback with suggestions for improvement based on voice/text inputs.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The AI Mock Interview Platform is designed to provide students, job seekers, and professionals with an accessible and intelligent system for interview preparation. The project focuses on delivering AI-driven interview simulations, real-time response analysis, and personalized feedback to help users improve their communication and technical skills.
